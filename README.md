# Facebook-Login-Page
🔐 Building a Facebook-Style Login Page with HTML & CSS 💻🎨

I recently developed a Facebook-inspired login page using HTML for structure and CSS for design. The page includes essential features like a form with email/password inputs, a "Forgot Password?" link, and a responsive layout for both desktop and mobile. Using CSS Flexbox and Grid, I ensured the page stays centered and accessible across devices.

A key challenge was replicating the sleek, minimalist design while maintaining functionality and responsiveness. Creating a clean, simple design while keeping the user experience intuitive took some trial and error, especially in achieving pixel-perfect alignment on various screen sizes.

Takeaway: Simplicity in design requires meticulous attention to detail, and it reinforced the importance of accessibility and responsive design in UI development.
